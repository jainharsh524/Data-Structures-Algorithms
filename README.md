# 📚 Data Structures & Algorithms in Java and C

Welcome to the **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** repository in **Java and C**!  
This repository contains a well-organized collection of Java implementations for classic and advanced data structures and algorithms. Perfect for interview prep, coding practice, and mastering Java and C fundamentals. Initially I was going to do  the whole DSA in java but due to some circumstances I had to learn C so from Now on DSA will be continued in C.
